/**
 * @brief The EffectRow class
 *
 * Primarily a way of grouping EffectField objects together. As UI objects, Effects are largely formatted as a table
 * and you can think of EffectRows as the rows of the table and EffectFields as the columns.
 *
 * Within Olive, keyframing is enabled on the EffectRow (rather than individual EffectFields) so all attached fields
 * will be keyframed together.
 *
 * Unlike EffectField, there's no reason to derive from EffectRow as it's simply a container of fields and a few
 * keyframe functions.

   * @brief EffectRow Constructor
   *
   * @param parent
   *
   * Every EffectRow object must be attached to a valid Effect object. The Effect object takes ownership of the
   * EffectRow and automatically frees it through the QObject parent/child system. EffectRows are never intended to
   * change parents throughout their lifetimes.
   *
   * @param id
   *
   * Field ID. Must be non-empty. Must also be unique within this Effect. Used for saving/loading values into project
   * files so that if ordering of fields are changed, or fields are added/removed from Effects later in development,
   * saved values in project files will still link with the correct field. Also used as the uniform variable name
   * in GLSL shaders.
   *
   * @param name
   *
   * Row name. This is not used as an internal identifier, it's just for the user interface, so it can be translated
   * with no issue.
   *
   * @param savable
   *
   * Whether the fields in this row should be saved to the project file. This is true by default. If the row contains
   * non-value UI widgets, setting this to false is recommended.
   *
   * @param keyframable
   *
   * Whether keyframing can be enabled on this row or not. This is true by default. Some values you may want to prevent
   * the user from keyframing (e.g. the filename of a VST plugin), which can be done by setting this to false.
